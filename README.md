⚠️ This project has been archived in favor of [intisync.ex](https://github.com/JasterV/intisync.ex). As much as I love rust, building a real-time, fault-tolerant application was a thousand times easier and more maintainable with Elixir & Phoenix. Rust might be great for a lot of problems but this wasn't an appropiate use case for it, eventhough I had a lot of fun working on this ⚠️

# IntiSync Server

IntiSync Socket.io server.

Allow clients to create private sessions and interact with each other in real time through the Socket.io protocol

### Notes on the project name

Despite the similarity on the name, this project is not endorsed by [Intiface](https://github.com/intiface) and [Intiface](https://github.com/intiface) is their own registered trademark.

I chose this name because this project was inspired by `Intiface` and the clients require the use of their software to connect the Hub to the bluetooth devices.

Also I find the name IntiSync very catchy and easy to remember.
